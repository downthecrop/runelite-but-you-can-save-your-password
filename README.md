# RuneLite But You Can Save Your Password (BYCSYP) [![CI](https://github.com/downthecrop/runelite-but-you-can-save-your-password/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=1.7.24)](https://github.com/downthecrop/runelite-but-you-can-save-your-password/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

RuneLite is a free, open source OldSchool RuneScape client... that didn't let you save your password and now you can!

The official stance from the RuneLite team is that this isn't a feature they are interested in adding (See [#13652](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/pull/13652) and [#249](https://github.com/runelite/plugin-hub/pull/249)) That's completely fine! We can create a fork of the project!

Isn't that a security risk?
  - Do you leave your password manager logged in? Yes?
  - Do you leave RS on your phone logged in? Yes?
  - Do you have the RuneScape Steam client linked with your Steam account that auto logs in? Yes?

Yes. Saving your password to disk is not super secure. We are trading a little security for a lot of convenience. Just enable an authenticator and type that in once a month.
